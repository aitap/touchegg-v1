= Introduction =

To facilitate Touchégg settings to other users, you can post in
[https://code.google.com/p/touchegg/issues/list Issues] tab your touchpad
name/pc name and your configuration to run Touchégg correctly.

Also, if you have any problem, you can ask about it in the same tab.



= General configuration =

Normally, Touchégg configuration, consists in change your touchpad
configuration to use evdev driver and _restart X._

Doing this is as simple as go to your /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ path and check
if exits any file like "nn-<trackpad name>.conf".
If exits change the Driver "<driver name>" line to Driver "evdev".



= Specific configuration =

 * *Apple Magic Trackpad:*

 Simply edit the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/60-magictrackpad.conf file and
 change the driver to evdev:
 {{{
 # Apple Magic Trackpad
 Section "InputClass"
      Identifier "Magic Trackpad"
      MatchUSBID "05ac:030e"
      Driver "evdev"
 EndSection
 }}}
 All gestures are detected and works fine.



 * *Asus eeepc 1000h (Buildin Elantech Trackpad)*

 Change driver from "synaptics" to "evdev" in
 /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf file:
 {{{
 Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad catchall"
    Driver "evdev"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
 EndSection
 }}}
 Not support more than three fingers gestures.

 * *!MacBook's (!MacBook, !MacBook Pro, !MacBook Air)*

 As say me [http://code.google.com/p/touchegg/issues/detail?id=12 "jlcleary87"]
 Touchégg is compatible with all aluminium !MacBook's and configuration is
 similar to the Magic trackpad configuration.

 Thanks jlcleary87!
