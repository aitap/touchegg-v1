 * *Apple Magic Trackpad:*

 /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 {{{
 [...]
 # Apple Magic Trackpad
 Section "InputClass"
      Identifier "Magic Trackpad"
      MatchUSBID "05ac:030e"
      Driver "evdev"
 EndSection
 [...]
 }}}
 All gestures and actions work well

 * *Asus eeepc 1000h with buildin elantech trackpad*

 Changed the driver from "synaptics" to "evdev" in the file 50-synaptics.conf found in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d

 After it looked like this
 {{{
 Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad catchall"
    Driver "evdev"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
 EndSection
 }}}

 Then restarted and manually started touchegg alt-f2, "touchegg" or start from terminal- so you can see the recognized finger taps
 It worked, but:
 Sadly the evdev driver didn't support more than 3 finger tap, so i had no improvement to the synaptics driver
